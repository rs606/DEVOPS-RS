DEVOPS ESSENTIAL NOTES:- 
A clone operation is essentially a copy of a repository and its history.

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository.

Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

Pull requests are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the Shared Repository Model.

Everyone shares a single repository, and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes.

Many open-source projects on GitHub use pull requests to manage changes from contributors.

They help provide a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made.

Also, start code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.

Pull requests combine the review and merge of your code into a single collaborative process.

Once you're done fixing a bug or new feature in a branch, create a new pull request.

Add the team members to the pull request so they can review and vote on your changes.

Use pull requests to review works in progress and get early feedback on changes.

There's no commitment to merge the changes as the owner can abandon the pull request at any time.
